# Shahana's Portfolio

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. The design focuses on simplicity, professionalism, and user-friendliness.

## Features

## Approach
1. **Design Choices**: 
   - Used a minimal color palette (blue and gray) for a professional look.
   - Selected Arial for a clean, modern typography.
2. **Challenges**: 
   - Ensured proper alignment and spacing across sections.
   - Managed CSS conflicts by organizing rules into blocks.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the portfolio.

## Future Plans
